# Folder customization (Advanced)
Input to the python script would be the directory name. The script will search for appropriate images 
(size = 256*256) for the folder at https://images.google.com/ considering the folder name as the search 
string.

It will download 'n' images (n <= 100) and select one at random to convert into an .ico file.
Value of 'n' is parameterized.

The selected image is converted to .ico format and saved in the appropriate subdirectory and applied
as its icon.
